- Canceling a Slide will dynamically impact the Slide cooldown
- Your character will no longer lose velocity at the end of a Slide
- Landing on the ground while inputting a SPRINT and a CROUCH will initiate a Slide immediantly upon landing
- Crouch transition speed increased by 20%
- Slide duration increased by 25%
- Slide cooldown increased to 1.4 seconds (previously 1 second)
- Removed Jump Sliding (was very powerful, but was only used by a handful of players, giving them a big advantage)

*NEW SETTING*
- Slide Cancel Type

**>MAPS**

**>BALANCE**
- Removed **Magnum Ammunition** from all weapons (was a free damage upgrade, couldn't tell when it was being used, new players who didn't learn to equip it were at a big disadvantage)

**>QOL & BUG FIXES**
- Official Servers now run on 60hz again (previously 30hz) (will monitor server performance to see if this runs smoothly)

- Decreased volume of sliding related sound effects

- The pitch of sliding related sound effects now slightly vary on each slide

- Adjusted visual effect of mantling

- Fixed some secondaries not firing underwater
