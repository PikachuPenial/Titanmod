**DISCLAIMER!!!**
- Default HUD settings now differ GREATLY as of this update, I recommend reverting to default through the HUD Editor, or at the very least, resetting all of your 'offset' settings due to the new HUD edge bound settings.

**>GAMEPLAY**
*NEW SETTINGS*
- HUD Edge Bounds X
- HUD Edge Bounds Y
- Damage Indicator toggle
- Damage Indicator color
- Damage indicator opacity

**>MAPS**
*Legacy*
- Added additional player spawns
- Fixed missing tree model

**>BALANCE**
*Beretta Mx4*
- Reduced damage to 27 (previously 28)
- Increased vertical recoil to 35 (previously 30)
- *Gun was very powerful, even beyond CQC, this should put it in a healthy spot.*

*Dual Skorpions*
- Increased RPM to 2400 (previously 1800)

*FAMAS*
- Now fires in Full Auto with 1100 RPMwww
- Reduced damage to 27 (previously 31)
- *I get it, you guys aren't fans of a burst fire mode being forced.*

*Glock 18*
- Increased Burst RPM to 1200 (previously 900)
- Renamed to 'Glock 18' (previously 'Glock 17') as the weapon better fits this firearm IRL

*KRISS Vector*
- Recoil has been flipped, requiring you to now pull up to control the weapon

*Mac 10*
- Increased damage to 22 (previously 21)
- *The Mac 10 can be seen as being 1:1 with the Uzi, but due to it being much harder to control, this change should make it more diverse.*

*MTs255*
- Increased RPM to 190 (previously 130)

*Stevens 620*
- Increased rechambering speed by 50%
- *The Stevens has been seen as the weakest shotgun for quite a while, this should make it much more capable of killing targets.*

*UMP9*
- Decreased vertical recoil to 17 (previously 25)
- Decreased horizontal recoil to 7 (previously 15)
- *While the gun was never hard to control, its DPS is still pretty low, this change should help it stand out.*
