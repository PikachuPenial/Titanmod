**>GAMEPLAY**
*NEW GAMEMODE (**King Of The Hill**)*
- KOTH is now in Titanmod! Fight for control over a specific part of the map to gain score

*QUICK WEAPON SWITCHING*
- A new setting (that is **ON** by default) that allows you to change to your Primary, Secondary, and Melee weapons with keybinds that you can set in Settings

*MAP VOTING REWORK*
- Map voting has been rewritten to have more variety and to be more applicable to player counts
- The first map will always be a map suitable for the player count (small map if less than 6 players are playing, large if more than 6)
- The second map can be any map in the game, allowing for small maps to rarely be playable on full lobbies (chaotic but fun)
