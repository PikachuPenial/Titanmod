**>DISCLAIMER**
All player data/stats/unlocks/levels have been **RESET** as of this update, this is a massive inconvenience, but it was required in order to switch to a safer and stable saving system, a data wipe should never have to occur ever again, and I am sorry for doing this so suddenly.

**>QOL & BUG FIXES**
*Player statistics and how they are saved after playing have been completely reworked to avoid future problems*

*New player statistics have been added*
- Highest Kill Game

- Times you have used a specific weapon

*Another attempt at fixing the Main Menu not always opening up on server connect*

*Correctly named some incorrect calling card names*

*Updated text of some statistics when viewing player stats through the scoreboard*

*Removed the function of the Main Menu statistics button, will be replaced with Leaderboards soon*
