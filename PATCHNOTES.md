**>GAMEPLAY**

- Music will now be paused and resumed when toggling the setting in the menu
- Music now dynamically changes volume when navigating to different parts of the menu
- Music now properly loops again

**>MAPS**

**>QOL & BUG FIXES**
*A bunch of optimization has been implemented, expect more consistent frame rates*

*Added SFX after a successful prestige*

*Added new gamemode backgrounds*

*Menu Music Volume setting now maxes out at a 2x multiplier (previously 1x)*

*Fixed ammo bar going out of bounds when chambering a extra round into a weapon*

*Servers with hibernation enabled no longer get stuck on the same map and gamemode if all players disconnect during the End Of Match phase*

*Functions that gather all player entities no longer grab bots (I don't know why bots would be on a Titanmod server but this is just in case someone does something funky)*

*A Hatsune Miku player model is no longer installed when joining a server running the gamemode (lmao)*
