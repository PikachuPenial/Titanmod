LOW PRIORITY | Backlog for new features and adjustments that are not important

Reworked player profile pages (heavily inspired by bad business profiles) (would replace the current statistics menu)
Encyclopedia (menu for information on each weapon)
New players greeting screen (also would serve as a small tutorial of sorts)
Leaderboards (would need to pull the database file, would still be cool but would take a while to implement)
