HIGH PRIORItY | Currently working on or is being focused

Reworked player profile pages (heavily inspired by bad business profiles) (would replace the current statistics menu)

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

LOW PRIORITY | Backlog for new features and adjustments that are not important

Daily challenges (would reset 4-6pm CST for all users, need to learn cookies to utilize this) (kills with weapon category/kills beyond # meters/headshot kills/sliding kills)
1-2 new maps (more large scale maps specifically)
Encyclopedia (menu for information on each weapon)
New players greeting screen (also would serve as a small tutorial of sorts)
Leaderboards (would need to pull the database file, would still be cool but would take a while to implement)
