Drowning system
Main Menu refactor
VIP gamemode (you can select a loadout?)
Reworked player profile pages (heavily inspired by bad business profiles) (would replace the current statistics menu)
Show amount of connecting players on scoreboard
Keybindable weapon quick switching
Item unlock tracking through scoreboard
