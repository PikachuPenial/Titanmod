LOW PRIORITY | Backlog for new features and adjustments that are not important

Assists system
Sudden death on match end (requires match system refactor)
Additional gamemodes (gun game is the priority)
Reworked player profile pages (heavily inspired by bad business profiles) (would replace the current statistics menu)
Encyclopedia (menu for information on each weapon)
New players greeting screen (also would serve as a small tutorial of sorts)
Leaderboards (would need to pull the database file, would still be cool but would take a while to implement)
