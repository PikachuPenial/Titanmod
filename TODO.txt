Sudden death on match end (requires match system refactor)
Reworked player profile pages (heavily inspired by bad business profiles) (would replace the current statistics menu)

New players greeting screen (also would serve as a small tutorial of sorts)
Leaderboards (would need to pull the database file, would still be cool but would take a while to implement)
