HIGH PRIORItY | Currently working on or is being focused

Profanity Filter (would probably require a custom chat system? sounds cool but also extremely tedious)
Reworked player profile pages (heavily inspired by bad business profiles) (would replace the current statistics menu)
Weaponry type for each weapon (things like Pistol/Rifle/Shotgun, allows for more tracking opportunities)
Unclosable warning screen if not all content is installed
Spawn reworks on problematic maps (Arctic, Nuketown)
Use net messages for:
    Map voting (would allow you to preview the amount of votes on each map)
    Customization (no noticable difference, but its more secure server side)
    (net messages are prone to being exploited by bad actors so securing the already existing ones will happen)

LOW PRIORITY | Backlog for new features and adjustments that are not important

Easter Egg (if you know you know) (if i dont get around to this in time ill still keep the skin in for the meantime, dont worry Unlucky)
Daily challenges (would reset 4-6pm CST for all users, need to learn cookies to utilize this) (kills with weapon category/kills beyond # meters/headshot kills/sliding kills)
More cosmetics (three models per accolade, potentially double the playermodel count)
1-2 new maps (more large scale maps specifically)
Encyclopedia (menu for information on each weapon)
New players greeting screen (also would serve as a small tutorial of sorts)
Leaderboards (would need to pull the database file, would still be cool but would take a while to implement)
Leaning? (did not play well last time it was tested, might refine and try again)
Zedorfski finishing his map (please dude it needs textures if you want it in by release)
