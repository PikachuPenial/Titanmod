HIGH PRIORItY | Currently working on or is being focused

Profanity Filter (would probably require a custom chat system? sounds cool but also extremely tedious)
Reworked player profile pages (heavily inspired by bad business profiles) (would replace the current statistics menu)
Unclosable warning screen if not all content is installed
Spawn reworks on problematic maps (Arctic, Nuketown)
Voice indicator

LOW PRIORITY | Backlog for new features and adjustments that are not important

Daily challenges (would reset 4-6pm CST for all users, need to learn cookies to utilize this) (kills with weapon category/kills beyond # meters/headshot kills/sliding kills)
More cosmetics (three models per accolade, potentially double the playermodel count)
1-2 new maps (more large scale maps specifically)
Encyclopedia (menu for information on each weapon)
New players greeting screen (also would serve as a small tutorial of sorts)
Leaderboards (would need to pull the database file, would still be cool but would take a while to implement)
Leaning? (did not play well last time it was tested, might refine and try again)
Zedorfski finishing his map (please dude it needs textures if you want it in by release)
