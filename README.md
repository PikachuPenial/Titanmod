Join the official [Titanmod Discord server](https://discord.gg/GRfvt27uGF) to keep up to date with updates and to find others to play with.

A [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/) gamemode centered around tense encounters consisting of snappy aim duels and fluid movement. The game is played in a Randomizer format, giving the player a random loadout each and every spawn. With over 130+ unique weapons, every loadout is different from the last. And with over 16+ maps and played-led map votes after each round, everything stays fresh and exciting.

Almost every aspact of Titanmod is configurable. Not only does it boast a wide array of settings for players to change at will, but Titanmod also comes with a config file, allowing server creators to change the experience to their liking.

Players can express themselves by choosing between countless player skins and player cards. Most of these are unlockable via accomplishments in game, giving players something to grind for. Players can also progress through Titanmod's leveling system, unlocking exclusive player cards along the way.

Titanmod has support for any Garry's Mod map, but I highly recommend playing on a map that is either included in the gamemode (doing this also enables Map Voting support), or one that has multiple spawns and allows for players to take advantage of Titanmod's movement systems.
