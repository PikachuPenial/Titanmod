# Titanmod

A WIP [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/) gamemode centered around tense encounters consisting of snappy aim duels and fluid movement. The game is played in a Randomizer format, giving the player a random loadout each and every spawn. With over 130+ unique weapons, every loadout is different from the last.

Almost every aspact of Titanmod is configurable. Not only does it boast a wide array of settings for players to change at will, but will have a control panel for admins, allowing them to modify the core game mechanics for fun and creative matches.

Players can express themselves by choosing between countless player skins and player cards. Most of these are unlockable via accomplishments in game, giving players something to grind for.

Titanmod has support for any Garry's Mod map, but I highly recommend playing on a map that is either included in the gamemode (doing this also enables Map Voting support), or one that has multiple spawns and allows for players to take advantage of Titanmod's movement systems.

# Titanmod is currently under private testing!
While you can just pull this repository and run the gamemode yourself, I do not recommend this. For a playable, and hopefully enjoyable experience, please wait for an official workshop release before playing and/or hosting a server for Titanmod.
